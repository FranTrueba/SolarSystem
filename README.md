# Augmented Reality in Geography Education
## Overview
The appropriate use of what is known as "Augmented Reality" allows students to increase their interest and understanding of Geography, recognizing the current limits of this science. This project aims to present the advantages and even the disadvantages of Augmented Reality in a structured and orderly manner.

Augmented Reality is considered to create a new form of teaching for students who are going through basic education levels, thereby supporting them to improve their academic performance.

## The Challenge of Geography
Undoubtedly, the subject of Geography is one of the most complex in its comprehension and memorization. The study of Geography implies that through a book you can find any place in the world and even the galaxy, to locate the position of planets, distinguishing them from asteroids, as in the case of Pluto, for example.

## Target Audience
This project aims to reach students of different ages and different school course levels, to facilitate them, through the advantages of Augmented Reality, the understanding that there are many other ways to learn a science, even through a fun and playful methodology.

## Augmented Reality Meets Education
A common question often asked is, "what happens when we combine Augmented Reality with Education?" The answer may be given in the sense that this combination forms a new alternative for learning. It will serve learners with various learning abilities - kinesthetic, visual, or auditory - to approach and take advantage of this teaching strategy, thereby facilitating and increasing academic performance and knowledge. Through this technique or application, students will be able to facilitate knowledge in the interaction of the real world with the virtual world.

## Pilot Study
This combination of techniques was piloted with a group of eleven students who were in the fourth and fifth years of primary school. Their interest in interacting with Augmented Reality, specifically in the study of the solar system, was observed.

Teachers also showed interest and commented that Augmented Reality would be a great tool in the classrooms because, among other reasons, it arouses playful interest in children. They, perhaps without realizing it, learn while playing.
